# PD2Custom Infamy

## What this mod does:

- After reaching at least level 130 user has an option to gain one level of infamy and return back to level 100 without loosing weapons,  skill tree points, saved skill trees or character loadouts. Achievement will be awarded and published to steam as well.


## What this mod doesn't allow:
- User cannot gain more than one level of infamy immidiately, level is always reset back to 100 to prevent being able to gain more infamy levels very fast, for example after gaining tremendous amount of experience (i.e. high level crime spree).
- Users bellow infamy 5 can't avoid infamy costs (fee and loosing spending money) by using this mod.
